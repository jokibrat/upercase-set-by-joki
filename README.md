# Case Converter

Case Converter is a simple JavaScript function designed to convert all lowercase letters in a string to uppercase.

## Installation

You can simply copy the `convertToUpperCase` function from `index.js` and paste it into your JavaScript project.

```javascript
// Import the function
const convertToUpperCase = require('./index');

// Or directly copy the function into your file
```

2. Call the `convertToUpperCase` function, passing the string you want to convert as an argument:

```javascript
// Example usage:
const originalString = "Hello, World!";
